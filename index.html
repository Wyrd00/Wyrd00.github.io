        		<h1>Rabindranath Tagore</h1>
				<p>Rabindranath Tagore (Bengali: রবীন্দ্রনাথ ঠাকুর) sobriquet Gurudev, was a Bengali polymath who reshaped his region's literature and music. Author of Gitanjali and its "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse", he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. </p>
				<p>In translation his poetry was viewed as spiritual and mercurial; his seemingly mesmeric personality, flowing hair, and other-worldly dress earned him a prophet-like reputation in the West. His "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. Tagore introduced new prose and verse forms and the use of colloquial language into Bengali literature, thereby freeing it from traditional models based on classical Sanskrit. He was highly influential in introducing the best of Indian culture to the West and vice versa, and he is generally regarded as the outstanding creative artist of modern India.</p>

				<h2>Selected Works</h2>
				<br>

					<em><h3>Where The Mind Is Without Fear</h3>
						<p>Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high<br>
						Where knowledge is free <br>
						Where the world has not been broken up into fragments <br>
						By narrow domestic walls <br>
						Where words come out from the depth of truth<br>
						Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection<br>
						Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way<br>
						Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit <br>
						Where the mind is led forward by thee <br>
						Into ever-widening thought and action <br>
						Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake</p>

					<h3>Unending Love</h3>
						<p>I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times…<br>
						In life after life, in age after age, forever. <br>
						My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs, <br>
						That you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms, <br>
						In life after life, in age after age, forever.</p><em>
		
						<p>Whenever I hear old chronicles of love, its age-old pain,<br>
						Its ancient tale of being apart or together.<br>
						As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge, <br>
						Clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time: <br>
						You become an image of what is remembered forever.</p>
			
						<p>You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount.<br>
						At the heart of time, love of one for another.<br>
						We have played along side millions of lovers, shared in the same<br>
						Shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewell-<br>
						Old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.</p>
	
						<p>Today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you<br>
						The love of all man’s days both past and forever:<br>
						Universal joy, universal sorrow, universal life.<br>
						The memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours –<br>
						And the songs of every poet past and forever.</p>

					<h3>Leave This</h3>
						<p>Leave this chanting and singing and telling of beads!<br>
						Whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut?<br>
						Open thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee!</p>
					
						<p>He is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground <br>
						and where the pathmaker is breaking stones.<br>
						He is with them in sun and in shower,<br>
						and his garment is covered with dust.<br>
						Put off thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil!</p>
					
						<p>Deliverance? <br>
						Where is this deliverance to be found? <br>
						Our master himself has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation;<br> 
						he is bound with us all for ever.</p>
					
						<p>Come out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers and incense!<br>
						What harm is there if thy clothes become tattered and stained?<br> 
						Meet him and stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow</p>
				<br>

					<h3>Last Curtains</h3>
						<p>I know that the day will come<br> 
						when my sight of this earth shall be lost,<br> 
						and life will take its leave in silence,<br> 
						drawing the last curtain over my eyes.</p> 
					
						<p>Yet stars will watch at night,<br> 
						and morning rise as before,<br>
						and hours heave like sea waves casting up pleasures and pains.</p>
					
						<p>When I think of this end of my moments,<br>
						the barrier of the moments breaks <br>
						and I see by the light of death <br>
						thy world with its careless treasures.<br> 
						Rare is its lowliest seat, <br>
						rare is its meanest of lives</p>
					
						<p>Things that I longed for in vain <br>
						and things that I got <br>
						---let them pass. <br>
						Let me but truly possess <br>
						the things that I ever spurned <br>
						and overlooked. </p>

					<h3>The Gardner #85</h3>
						<p>Who are you, reader, reading my poems a hundred years hence?<br>
						I cannot send you one single flower from this wealth of spring, one single streak of gold from yonder clouds.<br>
						Open your doors and look abroad.</p>

						<p>From your blossoming garden gather fragrant memories of the vanished flowers of a hundred years before.<br>
						In the joy of your heart may you feel the living joy that sang one spring morning, sending its glad voice across a hundred years.</p>
